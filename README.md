# Real Time Sudoku Solver Project

1/ Disclaimer:
- I knew almost nothing about Image Processing and Machine Learning when I started this project. Inspired by an awesome Augmented Reality Sudoku Solver made by geaxgx1 (Link below), I decided to make one of my own.

- Here is a list of the sources I used to build this project:
    + geaxgx1's Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR66rMS_ZfA&t=130s . It contains amazing, abstract instructions of how to build a Real Time Sudoku Solver (Please notice he didn't upload any code)
    + OpenCV Tutorial Playlist (47 videos, I watched 75% of them): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdLM6AOd2vc&list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K
    + Sentdex's Deep Learning Playlist (11 videos): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ8BIBpya2k&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfhTox0AjmQ6tvTgMBZBEXN
    + How to improve Digit Recognition Accuracy: https://medium.com/@o.kroeger/tensorflow-mnist-and-your-own-handwritten-digits-4d1cd32bbab4
    + How to extract Sudoku Grid: https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/tutorial/grid-detection-with-opencv-on-raspberry-pi
    + Interesting article in C++ about Sudoku Grabber: https://aishack.in/tutorials/sudoku-grabber-opencv-plot/
    + WarpPerspective: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/05/05/building-pokedex-python-opencv-perspective-warping-step-5-6/
    + Find 4 corners from contour: https://www.programcreek.com/python/example/89417/cv2.arcLength
    + Pixel viewers to see what goes wrong with my code: https://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/pixel-viewer/
    + And of course: https://stackoverflow.com/, https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html

2/ How does it work?
- Please watch my Youtube video: YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK
- You will need: Python 3, OpenCV 4, Tensorflow >= 2.1.0 and Keras.
